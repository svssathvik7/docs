# Token

SEED is the fundamental utility token at the heart of Garden, designed to fuel the platform's ecosystem and empower our community. Launched on January 18th, 2024, SEED facilitates community engagement, incentivizes participation, and enhances interactions within the protocol.

### Future Outlook[​](https://docs.garden.finance/home/basics/token/#future-outlook) <a href="#future-outlook" id="future-outlook"></a>

The SEED allocation for community incentives is dynamic, with the DAO determining its distribution to ensure alignment with community needs. Transparent tokenomics and governance-driven decisions will remain central as Garden evolves. Initiatives to onboard new chief gardeners and enhance community engagement will expand in future phases of the protocol.

SEED empowers holders to actively shape the Garden ecosystem.
