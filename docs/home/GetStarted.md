## What is Garden?

Garden is the fastest Bitcoin bridge and enables cross-chain Bitcoin swaps in as little as 30 seconds. It is built using an intents based architecture with trustless settlements, ensuring zero custody risk for the users.

Garden has facilitated over a billion dollars in volume and stands out from other bridges due to these [benefits](fundamentals/benefits/).

Garden is a community-driven project that encourages and appreciates developers' use of its composable dev stack to build cool Bitcoin cross-chain experiences. If you're a developer looking to integrate or build on Garden, these are good places to start:

* API: A simple breakdown of Garden's API usage.
* [SDK](https://docs.garden.finance/developers/sdk/): A simple guide to using the Garden SDK.
