## What is Garden?

Garden is the fastest Bitcoin bridge, enabling cross-chain Bitcoin swaps in as little as 30 seconds. It is built using an intents-based architecture with trustless settlements, ensuring zero custody risk for the users.

With over a billion dollars in volume facilitated, Garden stands apart from other bridges thanks to these [benefits](fundamentals/benefits/Benefits.md).
